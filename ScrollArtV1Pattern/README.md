## 1. Dog (Yeppi)

`ScrollArtV1Pattern.java` is a program that prints straight lines moving either left or right. 
Then a new line, at random intervals, branches off an existing line in the opposite direction. 
It creates a pattern that looks like a bunch of triangles. I was inspired by watching Al Sweigart's Scroll Art video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sjk4UMpJqVs&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fscrollart.org%2F&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjM4NTE).

## 2. Text-moji Art 

My text-moji art is in `ScrollArtV1.java`.
I made a dog using "ASCII DRAW STUDIO" to plan out my ascii art drawing.

#### Process 
This dog was inspired by my dog yeppi. Here is the actual drawing with my initials:

                                           
   .__                     .^^             
  /"  ";                  |   ")           
 .      \                /"  X ?           
 |" X   \              /   XX  |           
 \ XXX.  \+--._.__..-#/   XXXX  )          
 '  %$                    *--_  .          
 \                               |         
 .|    __               ___      \         
 |"   *###x*           #x## \     :        
 \   ( ###x@          x####       |        
 '.            _.._              ):        
  '.           \=  =/            /         
   \             ^^             .          
    +            /\            ?"          
     " _      *-"  "-*       /"             A.N.
         "+=.___\__/.__.--=="              
                                           
                                           
                                           
It was 32x34.

I decided to also make a 25x25 flower to make complete the requirements. Again, I used ASCII DRAW STUDIO to plan out and develop my ascii art 
drawing. 

#### Process 
This flower came from my head. Here is the actual drawing with my initials:

           _.__      __._                                      
        .-"   "@. _:"    ".    
       |"      "|/       /     
       "|       .       "~-.__  
        ".                    | 
          7      0          _/" 
        .|"              .-" 
       /.       .        "-      A.N.
       ~.-     .|\       .|  
        \      -" ".     /      
         "-._-./"  "-.__.' 
Then I input each individual character into its 2D location into Image.java, in the `getImage()` function.
